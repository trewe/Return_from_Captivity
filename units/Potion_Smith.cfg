    description= _ "The first 'Potion Smiths' were mockingly named by rival Runesmiths who believed that devoting one's time to the study of mixing potions and leaves was a worthless endeavor. As time passed the name remained, and is now given as a title of honor to Alchemists who have advanced their skills sufficiently to earn them renown on the battlefield. Defeating the effects of poison is the accomplishment of any Alchemist who becomes a Potion Smith, and their skills make them in high demand."

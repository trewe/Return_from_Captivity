0.8

 : fixed several small issues, cleaned up code

0.9.2
 : fixed 'open sesame' not triggering victory event
 : reduced heavely carryover gold since previous was insane
 : more code debuging

0.9.5
 : changed 2nd scenario map since it was to easy to defend the cave
	> added 4 more entries to the cave (2 flyer only)
	> it is still easy to hold the cave since the enemy had to enter via a 1 hex pathway (2 of them slowed down with water)
	> moved the naga recruit to the orcs (they need them more, but seems never recruit it)
 : nagas and bats now join the players in 'land of dragons' but aren't loyal
 : descluttered the macros (better multiplayer support)
 : rewritted the thirsty in open sesame (the previous has insanly complicated rules and only worked from time to time by chance)
	> all living units (also ai) except ambushers and trolls suffer thirst
	> make it more similar to the desydration of UtBS (so the player may know it)
 : reduced carryover again
 : decreased bonus gold (3000+ gold is simply to much to accumulate)
 : tried to rewritte the florestcutters code in 'save the forest'
	> they now at least move far more heavy to new forest tiles
	> added also a visual hint to remind the player what the cutters are doing
	> units with fire attacks also cut forest (to bring more pressure on the player)
 : troll guardians now open all free cells in 1st scenario (beware!)
 : finally had a look at the units
	> new graphics for the eaglerider (a thanks to the creator of era of magic)
	> new graphics for the human druid (woodwarriors - BEEM)
	> new special for the elfish raindancer and highter levels
	> minor  tweaks in stats
